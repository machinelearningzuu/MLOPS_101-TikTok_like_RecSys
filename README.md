## Lesson 1: Building a TikTok-like Recommender

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to:
- Design and implement a **real-time personalized recommender** using H&M fashion articles.
- Use the **two-tower embedding model** to create user and item embeddings.
- Apply the **4-stage recommender architecture** to handle millions of items with real-time recommendations.
- Leverage **MLOps best practices** with the **feature/training/inference (FTI)** architecture using the Hopsworks AI Lakehouse.

### Introduction to the H&M Dataset

We use the **H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations Dataset**, which includes:
- `articles.csv`: Information about fashion items.
- `customers.csv`: Data on customers.
- `transactions.csv`: Customer-article interactions.

We'll focus on meaningful interactions like clicks, cart additions, and purchases to train the models.

---

### Core Paradigms for Recommendations

1. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends items similar to those a user has interacted with.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Identifies patterns in user-item interactions to suggest items.

---

### The Two-Tower Embedding Model

The **two-tower model** computes embeddings for users and items in the same vector space:
- **Customer Query Encoder**: Converts customer features to embeddings.
- **Item Candidates Encoder**: Converts item features to embeddings.

This design supports:
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Using item and customer features.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Using customer-item interaction patterns.

---

### The 4-Stage Recommender Architecture

1. **Candidate Generation**: Retrieves relevant items from a large corpus.
2. **Filtering**: Removes irrelevant items (e.g., already purchased).
3. **Ranking**: Scores and ranks items based on user relevance.
4. **Reordering**: Presents the most personalized items to the user.

**Offline Pipeline**: Precomputes item embeddings using the two-tower model.  
**Online Pipeline**: Generates real-time recommendations.

---

### Deploying Offline ML Pipelines

Using **GitHub Actions** and the **FTI architecture**, youâ€™ll learn to:
- Automate feature extraction and model training pipelines.
- Deploy inference pipelines for real-time recommendations.

---

### Demo of the Recommender

The complete system is demonstrated using:
- **Hopsworks**: AI Lakehouse for feature store, model registry, and inference.
- **GitHub Actions**: Orchestrates offline pipelines.
- **Streamlit**: Frontend prototype to test the recommender.

### Quick Start

Follow the instructions in the [repository documentation](#) to:
- Set up Hopsworks.
- Deploy ML pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Test the recommender via a Streamlit-powered frontend.

---

## Next Steps

In **Lesson 2**, weâ€™ll dive deeper into:
- Feature pipelines and how to engineer robust features for the recommender.
- Leveraging Hopsworks to manage and deploy features.
